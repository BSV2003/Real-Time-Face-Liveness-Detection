## Abstract
Ensuring security in restricted areas is crucial for protecting valuable assets, sensitive information, and human safety. Traditional physical security systems have limitations in providing robust authentication for accessing official information. With the growing demands of modern society, face detection has become increasingly important. This project proposes a face-recognition system using OpenCV, the Haar Cascade classifier, and the LBP Classifier, focusing on optimizing the webcam distance to improve recognition efficiency.

The performance of both classifiers was measured in two scenarios: without considering distance and with considering distance. Experimental results show that the Haar Cascade classifier achieved 99.60% accuracy, outperforming the LBP classifier's 99.09% accuracy. When considering distance, the Haar Cascade classifier achieved 99.82% accuracy at a maximum distance of 2.73 meters with an average distance of 1.88 meters, while the LBP classifier achieved 99.56% accuracy at a maximum distance of 2 meters with an average distance of 1.41 meters.

This study concludes that the Haar Cascade classifier is more effective in terms of accuracy and optimal distance coverage compared to the LBP classifier.
